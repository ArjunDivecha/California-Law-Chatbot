## Data Handling Review

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Confidentiality Considerations

**According to California State Bar Guidance:**
> "A lawyer must not input any confidential information of the client into any generative AI solution that lacks adequate confidentiality and security protections."

### Google Gemini API Data Handling

**Key Findings from Google AI Terms of Service:**

1. **Data Transmission**
   - User queries are transmitted to Google servers for processing
   - Data transmitted over HTTPS/TLS encrypted connections
   - Server-side processing occurs on Google infrastructure

2. **Data Storage & Retention**
   - **Review Required:** Google's Terms of Service must be reviewed for specific data retention policies
   - **Recommendation:** Assume queries may be stored temporarily by Google for service improvement
   - **Action Required:** Verify current Google Gemini API data retention policy

3. **Data Usage for Training**
   - **Critical:** Google may use API inputs to improve models unless explicitly disabled
   - **Enterprise Options:** Google may offer enterprise tiers with data isolation
   - **Default Behavior:** Free/tiered APIs may use data for training

4. **Third-Party Access**
   - Google's privacy policy applies to data handling
   - Terms specify how Google may share data with affiliates/partners
   - Subprocessor agreements may apply

### ⚠️ COMPLIANCE RISK ASSESSMENT

**HIGH RISK for Confidential Client Information:**
- ❌ **DO NOT** input confidential client information using default API configuration
- ❌ **DO NOT** assume attorney-client privilege protections apply
- ❌ **DO NOT** use without reviewing Google's current Terms of Service
- ✅ **DO** anonymize all client data before use
- ✅ **DO** consult IT/cybersecurity professionals before use
- ✅ **DO** consider enterprise/business tier if available with better data protections

3. **Establish Firm Policies**
   - Define permissible uses
   - Specify data anonymization requirements
   - Create training protocols
   - Set supervision requirements

4. **Client Disclosure**
   - Consider disclosing AI use to clients
   - Explain benefits and risks
