### CEB Document Processing Pipeline

To add new CEB documents to the RAG system, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Process PDFs** (extract text and create chunks):
   ```bash
   python3 process_ceb_pdfs.py \
     --category <category> \
     --input-dir "/path/to/ceb_pdfs" \
     --chunk-size 1000
   ```
   
   Categories: `trusts_estates`, `family_law`, `business_litigation`, `business_entities`, `business_transactions`
   
   Output: `data/ceb_processed/<category>/chunks.jsonl`

3. **Generate embeddings** (create vector representations):
   ```bash
   python3 generate_embeddings.py \
     --category <category> \
     --input-file data/ceb_processed/<category>/chunks.jsonl
   ```
   
   Output: `data/ceb_processed/<category>/embeddings.jsonl`
   
   **Cost**: ~$0.0001 per 1K tokens (approximately $0.01-0.20 per 1,000 chunks)

4. **Upload to Upstash Vector**:
   ```bash
   python3 upload_to_upstash.py \
     --category <category> \
     --input-file data/ceb_processed/<category>/embeddings.jsonl
   ```
   
   Requires `.env` file with:
   - `UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL`
   - `UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN`
