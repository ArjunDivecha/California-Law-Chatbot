# California Law Chatbot

A sophisticated AI-powered legal research assistant specializing in California law, featuring real-time integration with authoritative legal databases and comprehensive citation verification.

> ⚠️ **V2 MIGRATION IN PROGRESS.** The sections below describe the **V1 production architecture** (OpenRouter-routed Gemini + Claude via the legacy orchestrator). V2 lives on branch `V2` and rewires inference to the **direct Anthropic Messages API** with an in-process agent loop, deleting roughly 7,800 lines of orchestration. The full V2 plan and status are tracked in `docs/MANAGED_AGENTS_RECONSTRUCTION_PLAN.md`. See **V2 Status** below for current state.

---

## V2 Status (auto-updated 2026-05-12)

This section is the canonical place to find out where the V2 migration stands. Other agents / scripts reading this file should treat the table below as ground truth; cross-reference the cited artifacts for detail.

### Pre-Phase-1 critical path (per 2026-05-10 ZDR-removal addendum)

| Step | What | Status | Artifact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | SDK upgrade `@anthropic-ai/sdk` 0.68.0 → 0.95.2 | ✅ done | commit `58dec1e`, `package.json` |
| 1 | Sanitization branch import + deep audit | ✅ done | `docs/sanitization-audit-2026-05-10.md` |
| 1b | Test-runner unblock (auditLog port + stubs) | ✅ done | commit `3c45f2d`, `api/_shared/auditLog.ts`, `components/draftingMagic/draftSectionState.ts` (stub), `hooks/useAttestation.ts` (stub) |
| 1c | §6 token-map retention decision (addendum #3) | ⏸ Option C drafted, **pending F&F partner sign-off** | `docs/MANAGED_AGENTS_RECONSTRUCTION_PLAN.md` 2026-05-12 third addendum |
| 2 | Threat model + **100-trap manifest** + runner | ✅ done (synthetic v1; F&F-matter half deferred 2026-05-12) | `tests/traps/manifest-v1.json`, `tests/traps/runTraps.mjs` |
| 3 | **Privilege smoke test, iterate to zero leaks** (HARD GATE) | ✅ **100/100 pass × 2 consecutive runs** | commit `06eb445`, `reports/traps-baseline-2026-05-12.json` |
| 4a | Upstash KV schema design | ✅ done | `docs/upstash-kv-schema-v1.md` |
| 4b | Anthropic-stack latency baseline | ✅ done | `reports/latency-baseline-2026-05-12.json`, `scripts/latency-baseline.mjs` |

### Latency baseline summary (2026-05-12, `claude-opus-4-7`, 5 queries per endpoint)

| Endpoint | success | e2e p50 (ms) | e2e p95 (ms) | TTFB p50 | TTFT p50 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `anthropic.messages.create` | 5/5 | 8247 | 9193 | — | — |
| `anthropic.messages.stream` | 5/5 | 7576 | 8277 | 1522 | 1523 |
| `anthropic.messages.stream + web_search` | 5/5 | 16904 | 18772 | 1681 | 1691 |
| `ceb_search` (embed + 5-namespace Upstash Vector) | 5/5 | 921 | 1122 | — | — |
| `courtlistener_search` | 5/5 | 2285 | 3299 | — | — |

These numbers are the comparison floor Phase 1 measures against. The `+ web_search` row is the Gemini-grounding replacement. The pre-bump Sonnet 4.6 numbers (2026-05-12 morning run) were `messages.create` p50 11716ms, `messages.stream` p50 10559ms, `+ web_search` p50 23927ms — Opus 4.7 came in measurably faster across all three Anthropic-side endpoints, likely a function of inference-side capacity rather than the model itself.

### Phase status

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| Phase 1 — Spike (agent loop + KV + tools + privilege-gated web_search + streaming + V2 chat UI) | ✅ first cut shipped (commits `8401011` → `9d94d1c` → `f2a4971`) — follow-ups per 2026-05-12 fifth addendum: Opus 4.7 default, MCP toolset support, Free Law Project MCP pilot, Skill-markdown extraction |
| Phase 2 — Drafting workflows | ❌ not started — **scope revised** per 2026-05-12 fifth addendum: pull Skill content from `anthropics/claude-for-legal/{commercial,corporate,ip}-legal/skills/*.md` (Apache-2.0) instead of authoring from scratch (~30–50% effort reduction) |
| Phase 3 — Verifier sub-agent | ❌ not started — **branched path** per 2026-05-12 fifth addendum: evaluate Solve Intelligence MCP first; if F1 ≥ acceptable, replace hand-rolled verifier with MCP tool call |
| Phase 4 — UI integration | ✅ first cut shipped at `/v2` (commit `f2a4971`); follow-ups: Clerk auth, session persistence, markdown / citation rendering, sidebar integration |
| Phase 4.5 — Shadow run | ❌ not started |
| Phase 5a — Cutover (deletes ~7,800 lines incl. `gemini/chatService.ts`, `agents/*`, `orchestrate-document.ts`) | ❌ not started |
| Phase 5b — Legacy teardown | ❌ not started |

### V2 commit timeline

```
06eb445  Step 3: iterate sanitization to zero leaks (100/100 trap pass × 2)

a720572  Sanitization audit fixes (May 11, V1 mechanical fixes for audit §8 4-7+10)
```

### Open dependencies

1. **F&F partner sign-off** on `docs/MANAGED_AGENTS_RECONSTRUCTION_PLAN.md` 2026-05-12 third addendum (Option C retention). The addendum is binding only after counsel ratifies; until then, the `audit_record_envelope:*` keys in `docs/upstash-kv-schema-v1.md` remain a draft schema.
2. **Gemini-grounding replacement acceptance criterion** for Phase 1 — tracked informally in conversation, not yet pinned in the plan. The replacement is `web_search_20250305` Anthropic tool with privilege gating (omit from `tools` array when input is privileged). `services/confidenceGating.ts` needs rewiring from Gemini grounding-metadata shape to Anthropic citations.
3. **V2 Portability Principle work** (2026-05-12 fourth addendum) — extract `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` from `agentLoop.ts` into `agents/california-legal/skills/*.md`, agent config into `agents/california-legal/agent.yaml`, define `source` block schema for tool results. Phase 1 follow-up; should land before Phase 5 cutover so a future Managed-Agents-or-equivalent runtime swap stays cheap.
4. **Anthropic 2026-05-12 legal-launch adoption** (2026-05-12 fifth addendum) — Phase 1 follow-up work: default model → `claude-opus-4-7`, MCP toolset support (`mcp_servers` parameter + `mcp-client-2025-11-20` beta header + `mcp_tool_use`/`mcp_tool_result` block handling in the agent loop), Free Law Project CourtListener MCP pilot, inlined Apache-2.0 litigation Skills (matter-intake, claim-chart, legal-hold, privilege-log-review) as system-prompt augmentation. **Open question**: F&F Thomson Reuters subscription status (gates the Westlaw / KeyCite / Practical Law MCP adoption in Phase 2). **Cost-impact decision** before Phase 4.5 shadow run: Opus 4.7 model cost is materially higher than Sonnet 4.6 — Arjun chooses among session-cap / tier-route / accept-cost.

### How to verify status reproducibly

```bash
yarn install
yarn test:sanitization        # 103 pass / 39 fail baseline (the 39 are documented Phase 1/2/4 scaffolding gaps)
yarn test:traps               # MUST report 100/100 — Step 3 gate
yarn latency:baseline         # writes reports/latency-baseline-{date}.json (consumes API credits)
```

### CEB Document Processing Pipeline

To add new CEB documents to the RAG system, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Process PDFs** (extract text and create chunks):
   ```bash
   python3 process_ceb_pdfs.py \
     --category <category> \
     --input-dir "/path/to/ceb_pdfs" \
     --chunk-size 1000
   ```
   
   Categories: `trusts_estates`, `family_law`, `business_litigation`, `business_entities`, `business_transactions`
   
   Output: `data/ceb_processed/<category>/chunks.jsonl`

3. **Generate embeddings** (create vector representations):
   ```bash
   python3 generate_embeddings.py \
     --category <category> \
     --input-file data/ceb_processed/<category>/chunks.jsonl
   ```
   
   Output: `data/ceb_processed/<category>/embeddings.jsonl`
   
   **Cost**: ~$0.0001 per 1K tokens (approximately $0.01-0.20 per 1,000 chunks)

4. **Upload to Upstash Vector**:
   ```bash
   python3 upload_to_upstash.py \
     --category <category> \
     --input-file data/ceb_processed/<category>/embeddings.jsonl
   ```
   
   Requires `.env` file with:
   - `UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL`
   - `UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`

**Current Status**: 77,406 vectors across 5 categories are already processed and uploaded.

### Legislative API Integration ✅ (Complete)
