---

#### 3. Case Law Questions

**Example 1: Famous Case**
```
User: "What did the California Supreme Court say in Brown v. Board of Education?"
```
**What Happens:**
- Smart detection: IS a case law query (contains "court", "case name pattern")
- CourtListener ACTIVATES
- Searches for "Brown v. Board of Education California"
- Returns relevant California cases

**Note:** Brown v. Board is a U.S. Supreme Court case, so the bot may note that it's federal, not California-specific.

---

**Example 2: California Case**
```
User: "What is the holding in In re Marriage of Brown?"
```
**What Happens:**
- Detects case name pattern "In re Marriage of X"
- CourtListener searches California family law cases

"In re Marriage of Brown is a California Court of Appeal decision addressing [specific family law issue]. The court held that... [cites CourtListener source]"

---

#### 4. General Legal Questions

**Example 1: Procedure**
```
User: "How do I file for divorce in California?"
```
**What Happens:**
- NOT a case law query (no "court", "case", "v.")
- NOT a specific bill/statute query
- Google Search grounding may activate
- Gemini uses training + grounded search

**Expected Response:**
"To file for divorce in California, you must meet residency requirements (6 months in state, 3 months in county). The process involves:
1. File Petition (FL-100)
2. Serve spouse
3. Wait 6-month mandatory waiting period

**Example Conversation:**
```
User: "What is California Family Code 4320?"
Bot: [Explains spousal support factors]

User: "What about the duration of marriage factor?"
```
**What Happens:**
- System maintains conversation history
- Knows "the duration of marriage factor" refers to Family Code 4320
- Provides context-aware answer

**Expected Response:**
"Regarding Family Code ¬ß 4320's duration of marriage factor from your previous question: California courts consider how long the couple was married. For marriages under 10 years ('short-term'), there's typically a presumption that support lasts half the length of the marriage. For marriages over 10 years ('long-term'), courts retain jurisdiction indefinitely..."

### Interpreting Response Badges

| Badge | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **‚úì Verified** | All claims checked against sources, 100% verified | High confidence - use with normal caution |
| **‚ö† Partially Verified** | Most claims verified (60-99%), some unverified | Review carefully, verify critical details |
| **‚ö† Verification Recommended** | Low verification rate or ambiguous sources | Consult attorney before relying on information |
| **CourtListener Enhanced** | Case law sources included from court database | Case citations should be independently verified |
| **üîç Google Search Grounding** | Recent web data included (2024-2025) | Most current information, but verify dates/details |

### Best Practices for Users

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Ask specific questions about California law
- Request specific statutes or code sections
- Ask about recent legislation (the system has 2024-2025 data)
- Follow up with clarifying questions
- Click source links to verify primary sources
- Consult an attorney before relying on information for legal decisions

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Input confidential client information (system warns against this)
- Rely on the chatbot for legal advice (it's a research tool only)
- Assume all information is 100% current without verification
- Use for non-California legal questions (system is CA-focused)
- Skip verification of critical details (dates, amounts, deadlines)

### Query Optimization Tips

**Be Specific:**
```
‚ùå "Tell me about divorce"
‚úÖ "What are the grounds for divorce in California?"
‚úÖ "How is spousal support calculated under Family Code 4320?"
```

**Include Statute Numbers When Known:**
```
‚ùå "What's the law about child custody?"
‚úÖ "What does Family Code 3011 say about child custody factors?"
```

**Specify Bill Numbers:**
```
‚ùå "What did California pass about AI?"
‚úÖ "What does SB 53 require for AI developers?"
```

**Ask About Recent Changes:**
```
‚úÖ "What changed in California privacy law in 2024?"
‚úÖ "Are there new AI regulations as of 2025?"
```

## Anti-Hallucination Methodology

### Layer 1: Generator Constraints (Gemini)

**System Prompt Engineering:**
```
"You are a California legal research assistant. Your role is to be helpful and informative.

GUIDELINES:
1. BE HELPFUL FIRST: Provide comprehensive, useful answers
2. CITE WHEN POSSIBLE: Use [1], [2] citations for provided sources
3. PRIORITIZE PROVIDED SOURCES: Full bill text supersedes training data
4. PROVIDE CONTEXT: Include background, requirements, procedures
5. USE YOUR KNOWLEDGE: You have extensive California law knowledge
6. BE SPECIFIC: Include statute numbers, case names, legal principles
7. VERIFY WHEN CRITICAL: Suggest verification for exact dates, amounts

IMPORTANT - FULL BILL TEXT:
When "FULL BILL TEXT" appears in sources, this is ACTUAL, CURRENT law.
Quote directly and explain. This supersedes your training data.

DO NOT say things like:
- "I cannot provide information without sources"
- "I need you to provide the statute text"
```

**Temperature Setting:** 0.2 (low) for legal accuracy and reduced creativity/hallucination

### Layer 2: Two-Pass Verification (Claude Haiku)

**Verification Process:**

1. **Claim Extraction:**
   ```javascript
   // Extract specific claims from generator's answer
   claims = [
     "California Family Code ¬ß 4320 lists 14 factors",
     "The court must consider duration of marriage",
     "Spousal support is tax-deductible until 2019"
   ]
   ```

2. **Source Matching:**
   ```javascript
   // For each claim, check if it's supported by sources
   for (claim in claims) {
     isSupported = verifyAgainstSources(claim, sources)
     if (!isSupported) {
       unsupportedClaims.push(claim)
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Verification Report:**
   ```javascript
   {
     coverage: 0.85,        // 85% of claims verified
     minSupport: 1,         // Each verified claim has ‚â•1 source
     ambiguity: false,      // No conflicting sources
     supportedClaims: 11,
     unsupportedClaims: 2,
     totalClaims: 13
   }
   ```

### Layer 3: Confidence Gating

**Dynamic Thresholds Based on Data Quality:**

| Data Source | Coverage Threshold | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Google Search Grounding** | 20% | Real-time data from Google is authoritative and current |
| **Full Bill Text** | 30% | Actual legislative text is authoritative primary source |
| **Normal Sources** | 60% | Standard verification level for excerpts and citations |

**Gating Logic:**
```javascript
if (coverage === 1.0 && minSupport >= 1 && !ambiguity) {
  return "VERIFIED" // Show answer as-is
}
else if (coverage >= threshold) {
  return "PARTIALLY_VERIFIED" // Show with caveat
}
else {
  return "REFUSAL" // Don't show, suggest attorney consultation
}
```

**Example Caveats:**
- Google Grounding: "This response includes recent information from Google Search."
- Bill Text: "This response is based on the actual bill text provided."
- Partial: "Note: 3 claims could not be fully verified against provided sources."

### Layer 4: Guardrails System

**Citation Validation:**
```javascript
// Check that all [1], [2] references point to actual sources
citations = extractCitations(answer)  // Find all [n] markers
for (citation in citations) {
  if (citation.index >= sources.length) {
    block("Citation [" + citation.index + "] references non-existent source")
  }
}
```

**Legal Entity Validation:**
```javascript
patterns = {
  statutes: /¬ß\s*\d+/,           // ¬ß 123
  years: /\b(19|20)\d{2}\b/,     // 2024, 1995
  amounts: /\$[\d,]+/,           // $5,000
  codes: /Code\s*¬ß?\s*\d+/       // Family Code ¬ß 4320
}

for (entity in extractedEntities) {
  if (!foundInSources(entity)) {
    warn("Entity '" + entity + "' not found in source excerpts")
  }
}
```

**Non-California Detection:**
```javascript
nonCAReporters = ['U.S.', 'F.2d', 'F.3d', 'F.Supp']
if (answer.includes(nonCAReporter)) {
  warn("Non-California citation found - this chatbot focuses on CA law")
}
```

**Error Handling:**
```javascript
if (criticalErrors.length > 0) {
  return "BLOCKED: Answer contains unsupported citations"
}
if (warnings.length > 0) {
  logWarnings(warnings) // Log but allow answer
}
```

## Real-Time Data & Grounding

### Google Search Grounding Implementation

**How It Works:**

1. **Request Structure:**
   ```javascript
   const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
     model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
     contents: userQuery,
     config: {
       tools: [{googleSearch: {}}],  // Enable web search
       generationConfig: { temperature: 0.2 }
     },
     systemInstruction: { /* California law expert prompt */ }
   });
   ```

2. **Gemini's Process:**
   - Analyzes user query
   - Determines if web search would help
   - Issues Google search queries automatically
   - Retrieves recent web results
   - Grounds response in current data

3. **Response with Grounding Metadata:**
   ```javascript
   {
     text: "California passed SB 53 on Sept 29, 2025...",
     candidates: [{
       groundingMetadata: {
         webSearchQueries: [
           "California AI bills 2025",
           "SB 53 California artificial intelligence"
         ],
         groundingChunks: [
           {
             web: {
               uri: "https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/29/...",
               title: "Governor Newsom Signs SB 53",
               domain: "gov.ca.gov"
             }
           }
         ]
       }
     }]
   }
   ```

4. **Verification Adjustment:**
   - System detects `hasGrounding = true`
   - Lowers verification threshold to 20%
   - Trusts Google Search results as authoritative
   - Preserves grounding URLs for user reference

**Why This Works:**
- Google Search provides data beyond AI training cutoff (April 2024)
- Prioritizes .gov and official sources
- Real-time information about recent legislation
- Reduces "I don't know" responses for current events

### Full Bill Text Retrieval

**Process Flow:**

1. **Detection:**
   ```javascript
   // User asks: "What does AB 489 say?"
   billPattern = /\b(AB|SB)\s*\d+\b/i
   match = query.match(billPattern)  // "AB 489"
   ```

2. **Parallel API Calls:**
   ```javascript
   Promise.all([
     fetch('/api/openstates-search?query=AB 489'),
     fetch('/api/legiscan-search?query=AB 489')
   ])
   ```

3. **Bill Text Retrieval:**
   ```javascript
   // If bill found, get full text
   if (billId) {
     billText = await fetch('/api/openstates-billtext?billId=' + billId)
     // Returns: { title, text: "FULL TEXT...", versionNote }
   }
   ```

4. **Enhanced Source:**
   ```javascript
   sources.push({
     title: "FULL BILL TEXT: AB 489 - AI in Healthcare",
     url: "https://openstates.org/...",
     excerpt: billText.substring(0, 3000),  // First 3000 chars
     type: "bill_text",
     fullText: billText  // Complete text available
   })
   ```

5. **Priority in Response:**
   - System prompt tells Gemini: "FULL BILL TEXT supersedes training data"
   - Verifier sees `hasBillText = true`
   - Threshold drops to 30% (from 60%)
   - Answer includes: "According to the full text of AB 489..."
