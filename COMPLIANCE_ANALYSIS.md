## Compliance Requirements & Current Status

### 1. Duty of Confidentiality ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLIANT

**Requirement:**
- Must not input confidential client information into AI without adequate protections
- Must anonymize client information
- Must ensure AI provider doesn't share inputted information with third parties or use it for training

**Current Status:**
- ✅ API keys stored server-side only
- ✅ No user data is persisted
- ⚠️ **GAP**: No explicit warning to users about confidentiality risks
- ⚠️ **GAP**: No guidance on anonymizing client information before input
- ⚠️ **GAP**: No documentation of Gemini API's data handling practices

**Required Changes:**
1. Add prominent confidentiality warning in UI
2. Add guidance on anonymizing queries
3. Document Gemini API's data handling (check Terms of Use)
4. Add client-facing notice about data transmission to third-party AI services

---

### 2. Duties of Competence and Diligence ✅ MOSTLY COMPLIANT

**Requirement:**
- Must understand technology limitations
- Must critically review, validate, and correct AI outputs
- Must not over-rely on AI tools
- Cannot delegate professional judgment to AI

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Verification system implemented (`verifyResponse` method)
- ✅ Warning badges for unverified claims
- ✅ Source citations provided
- ✅ Disclaimer in footer: "This is an AI research tool. Information may not be accurate."
- ⚠️ **GAP**: No explicit statement that outputs must be reviewed by qualified attorney
- ⚠️ **GAP**: No documentation of AI limitations in user-facing material

**Required Changes:**
1. Strengthen disclaimer to explicitly state outputs require attorney review
2. Add warnings about AI hallucinations and inaccuracies
3. Enhance verification warnings to be more prominent

---

### 3. Communication Regarding Generative AI Use ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

**Requirement:**
- Should disclose to clients that generative AI will be used
- Should explain how technology will be used, benefits and risks

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Basic disclaimer exists
- ⚠️ **GAP**: No explicit disclosure that generative AI (Gemini) is being used
- ⚠️ **GAP**: No explanation of benefits/risks of AI use
- ⚠️ **GAP**: No opt-in/acknowledgment mechanism

**Required Changes:**
1. Add prominent disclosure that the system uses Google Gemini AI
2. Add explanation of risks (hallucinations, inaccuracies, bias)
3. Consider adding user acknowledgment before first use

---

### 4. Candor to the Tribunal ✅ COMPLIANT

**Requirement:**
- Must review all AI outputs for accuracy before submission to court
- Must correct errors or misleading statements
- Should check for rules requiring disclosure of AI use

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Verification system checks for accuracy
- ✅ Warning badges indicate when verification is needed
- ⚠️ **GAP**: No explicit court-use warning

**Required Changes:**
1. Add prominent warning about court submission requirements
2. Add guidance on checking local court rules for AI disclosure

---

### 5. Prohibition on Discrimination ✅ COMPLIANT (with note)

**Requirement:**
- Must be aware of AI biases
- Should establish policies to identify and address biases

**Current Status:**
- ✅ System uses multiple authoritative sources (reduces bias)
- ⚠️ **GAP**: No documentation of bias awareness or mitigation measures

**Required Changes:**
1. Add statement acknowledging potential AI biases
2. Document bias mitigation efforts (using authoritative sources)

---

### 6. Charging for Work Produced by Generative AI ✅ N/A

**Status:** This appears to be a public-facing research tool, not a fee-charging service. If monetized in future, would need fee agreement compliance.

---

### 7. Duty to Supervise ⚠️ N/A (for public tool)

**Status:** Applies to law firms supervising lawyers/nonlawyers. If this tool is used within a law firm context, supervisory policies would be needed.

---

## Critical Gaps Summary

### HIGH PRIORITY

1. **Confidentiality Warnings** - Add prominent warnings about not inputting confidential client information
2. **Enhanced Disclaimers** - Strengthen all disclaimers to explicitly state:
   - Not legal advice
   - Requires attorney review
   - AI may produce inaccurate information
   - No attorney-client relationship created
3. **AI Disclosure** - Explicitly state that Google Gemini AI is being used
4. **Data Handling Documentation** - Document how Gemini API handles user queries

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

5. **Anonymization Guidance** - Add instructions on how to anonymize client information
6. **Court Use Warning** - Add specific warnings about court submission requirements
7. **Bias Acknowledgment** - Add statement about potential AI biases

---

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Disclaimers (Immediate)

1. Update `ChatInput.tsx` footer disclaimer
2. Add prominent banner/warning in `App.tsx` header
3. Add initial screen disclosure before first use

### Phase 2: Documentation & Guidance

1. Create `PRIVACY_AND_CONFIDENTIALITY.md` document
2. Add "How to Use Safely" section to README
3. Document Gemini API Terms of Use review

### Phase 3: Enhanced UI Elements

1. Add confidentiality warning modal
2. Enhance verification badges with more detail
3. Add "AI Limitations" information panel

---

## Next Steps

1. Review Google Gemini API Terms of Use for data handling
2. Implement enhanced disclaimers (Phase 1)
3. Add confidentiality warnings (Phase 1)
4. Create user guidance documentation (Phase 2)
5. Consider adding user acknowledgment mechanism
