## How to Anonymize Client Information

### Before Inputting Any Query:

1. **Remove client names** - Use "Client A" or "Party X"
2. **Remove identifying details** - Dates, addresses, specific case numbers
3. **Generalize facts** - Use hypothetical scenarios
4. **Remove case-specific information** - Don't reference specific cases or matters
5. **Use generic terms** - "a landlord" instead of specific person/entity

### Example: Anonymization

**❌ UNSAFE:**
> "My client John Smith was arrested on January 15, 2024, at 123 Main St. for a DUI. What are the penalties?"

**✅ SAFE (Anonymized):**
> "What are the penalties for a first-time DUI offense in California?"
